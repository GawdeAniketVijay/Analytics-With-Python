Numpy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provide a high-performance multidimensional array object,and tools for workingt with these arrays.
It is the fundamental packages for scientific computing with python.

Pandas Data processing is an important part of analyzing the data, because data is not always available in desired fromat. various process are requried before analyzing the data
such as cleaning, restructuring or merging etc. Numpy, Scipy, Cython and Pandas are the tools avaliable in python which can be used for fast processing of the data.

Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D arrays, Matplotlib is a multi-plotform data visualization library built on Numpy arrays and designed to work with 
the broader Scipy Stack.
